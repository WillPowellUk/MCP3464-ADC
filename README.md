# MCP3464-ADC
Upon popular request, I have created a simple driver/library for the MCP3464 ADC.

This driver is ready to go if you are running arduino.  

I have not made it portable for any microcontroller, however feel free to fork this repository and make it portable between chips.

# Setup
If you have arduino, simply upload the .ino file.
